Master of Science in Engineering (MSc Eng), Computer Science, Silesian University of Technology.

My primary area of interests is **multimedia processing**, with a specific focus on:

- digital image processing including medical imaging, wavelet algorithms and computer vision,
- designing scalable audio, video or others real-time transmission systems for distributed network environments,
- implementing secure archiving and transfer protocols for multimedia using advanced encryption techniques.

### Academic & research background

**Master's thesis:**
Analysis of a discrete wavelet transform without dyadic subsampling (SWT), augmented with a novel subband weight estimator, designed for edge detection in digital images heavily corrupted by high-frequency noise. [View presentation and results on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miloszgilga).

**Engineering thesis:**
A demonstration of communication capabilities in a highly distributed microservice infrastructure. The project utilized Apache Kafka and an event-driven architecture to build a real-time chat application in JVM environment and Netflix microservices stack. [Source code and Thesis (LaTeX)](https://github.com/visphere).
