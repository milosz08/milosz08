Master of Science in Engineering (MSc Eng), Computer Science, Silesian University of Technology.

Mainly interest to **multimedia processing**, including:

- digital image processing, including medical imaging and computer vision,
- designing real-time audio/video streaming applications for highly distributed network environments,
- secure internet transfer and archiving of multimedia data using selected encryption techniques.

**Master thesis:** My master’s thesis focused on the analysis of a discrete wavelet transform without dyadic
subsampling, augmented with a novel subband weight estimator, for the purpose of edge detection in digital images
heavily corrupted by high-frequency noise. Presentation with results available on my
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miloszgilga).

**Engineering thesis:** My engineering thesis was about demonstrate possibilities of communication in a highly
distributed microservice infrastructure using Apache Kafka event-driven architecture in field of real-time communication
on example of chat application. Source code and thesis (in LaTeX) you find [here](https://github.com/visphere).
