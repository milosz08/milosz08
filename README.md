	<b>Master thesis:</b>
	<br>
	My master’s thesis focused on the analysis of a discrete wavelet transform without dyadic subsampling, augmented with
	a novel subband weight estimator, for the purpose of edge detection in digital images heavily corrupted by
	high-frequency noise. Presentation with results available on my
