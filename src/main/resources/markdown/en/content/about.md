## About me

{{badge 'projects$$232925$/projects'}}
{{badge 'my blog (articles)$$0077B5$https://www.linkedin.com/in/miloszgilga/recent-activity/articles'}}

I am a Master of Science graduate in Computer Science from the Silesian University of Technology. I am passionate about
creating custom systems, ranging from standalone applications to complex, network-based solutions. While highly
proficient in modern frameworks like Spring Boot, I often develop bespoke solutions, relying on a deep understanding of
foundational technologies. I have hands-on experience with lightweight embedded application containers, such as Jetty,
and low-level programming with raw TCP/UDP sockets.

I complement my software engineering skills with research interests in multimedia data processing. In my free time, I
expand my skills in the practical application of methods that combine deep neural networks with wavelet algorithms for
signal processing (images and audio), particularly in the context of automatic feature extraction (e.g., segmentation,
polyphony).

Currently, my focus is on developing [JWizard](https://github.com/jwizard-bot), a highly distributed, modular, scalable,
and fault-tolerant platform. It is an open-source software solution, primarily based on Kotlin, Python, and Typescript,
that enables audio playback on Discord voice channels. I am personally responsible for the entire project lifecycle,
from application code and CI/CD pipeline configuration to the management of all cloud and network infrastructure.

## Education

* **2025 - current**: (postgraduate) Cyber Science - Cyber Management, NASK with Silesian University of Technology,

* **2024 - 2025**: (MSc Eng) Computer Science, Silesian University of Technology,
	* Grade: 5 (4.82).
	* My master’s thesis focused on the analysis of a discrete wavelet transform without dyadic subsampling, augmented
	  with a novel subband weight estimator, for the purpose of edge detection in digital images heavily corrupted by
	  high-frequency noise.
	* Additional achievements: awarded the Rector's Scholarship for outstanding academic performance.

* **2020 - 2024**: (Eng) Computer Science, Silesian University of Technology,
	* Grade: 5 (4.67).
	* My engineering thesis was about demonstrate possibilities of communication in a highly distributed microservice
	  infrastructure using Apache Kafka event-driven architecture in field of real-time communication on example of chat
	  application. Source code and thesis (in LaTeX) you find [here](https://github.com/visphere).

* **2017 - 2020**: High School, biology-chemistry profile.

## Interests and abilities

My interests are mainly focused on topics related to multimedia data processing, primarily including:

* digital image processing, including medical imaging and computer vision,
* designing applications for real-time audio/video streaming in highly distributed environments,
* secure internet transfer and archiving of multimedia data using selected encryption techniques.

Throughout my education, I have acquired specialized skills in:

* digital signal processing,
* computer vision and fundamentals of machine learning,
* discrete-event simulation modeling (queueing systems),
* mathematical modeling (static/dynamic systems analysis — phase-space trajectories),
* fundamentals of biology and chemistry enabling work with bioinformatics and medical informatics (digital processing of
  biomedical images).

I am enthusiastic of languages running on the JVM such as Java, Kotlin and Scala, but also more _exotic_ ones such as
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org).

I am proficient in a number of popular programming languages (Java, Kotlin, Javascript, Typescript, PHP, C#, C, Python)
and to a greater or lesser extent I know the basics of several other languages (Scala, C++, Matlab, R) including those
_exotic_ (the aforementioned [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) language).

## Technologies

Technologies I am working with in my current projects:

* JVM (Kotlin, Java, Scala; Spring and Spring Boot ecosystems),
* C/C++ (JNI, DSP in field of audio modulation and multimedia processing: SRT, OpenCV, LavaDSP),
* Python (process automation, digital images processing, scientific simulations: OpenCV, Pandas, PyWavelets, Matplotlib,
  Numpy, Scipy),
* JavaScript/TypeScript (with Next.js and React ecosystem: Redux Toolkit, RTK Query and Tanstack Query;
  websites and rapid prototyping),
* Message brokers (RabbitMQ),
* GCP (KMS, Compute Engine),
* OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure: Compute, VCN, Block Storage),
* Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, BetterStack),
* DevOps (Cloudflare, Nginx, Caddy, Hashicorp Vault, Minio, GitHub Actions, Docker),
* LaTeX (book, article, beamer).

Technologies I know and have used in the past:

* .NET (C#, ASP.NET WebAPI, WinForms),
* Angular ecosystem (with RxJS),
* Apache Kafka (fault tolerant distributed data streams, event-driven architecture),
* microservices (Spring Cloud architecture),
* Scilab (circuits simulations),
* Apache Cassandra,
* Redis,
* AWS (EC2, Lambda, KMS, S3, DynamoDB),
* Matlab (digital signals/images processing),
* PHP (native),
* Android (Java).

## Hobby

Privately a homebody, an enthusiast of film music, classical, and cross-genre music, a connoisseur of independent
arthouse movies and Open Source software.
