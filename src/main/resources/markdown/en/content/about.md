## About me

Currently master of science student at Silesian University of Technology (faculty of Automatic Control, Electronics and
Computer Science, spec: Internet and Networking Technologies).

In january 2024 I defended Bachelor of Engineering at the same university. My thesis was about demonstrate possibilities
of communication in a highly distributed microservice infrastructure using Apache Kafka event-driven architecture in
field of real-time communication on example of chat application.

My thesis is available [here](https://github.com/visphere/visphere-thesis).
Source code you find [here](https://github.com/visphere).

Currently, I'm focusing on:

* researching wavelet transformation applications for edge detection in practical image analysis under varying noise
  levels and artifacts (the results will be included in my master's thesis),
* developing [JWizard](https://github.com/jwizard-bot) — a highly distributed, modular, scalable, and fault-tolerant
  open-source platform (primarily written in Kotlin, Python and TypeScript) for audio content playback on Discord voice
  channels ([more about project](/project/jwizard)),

and I'm learning:

* practical applications of machine learning (convolutional neural networks, CNNs) as a support for classical image
  processing algorithms in the context of automatic segmentation and features detection.

## Education

* **2024 - current**: (MSc) Computer Science, Silesian University of Technology,
* **2020 - 2024**: (BEng) Computer Science, Silesian University of Technology,
* **2017 - 2020**: High School of the Evangelical Society in Cieszyn (biology-chemistry profile).

Throughout my education, I have acquired specialized skills in:

* digital signal processing,
* computer vision and fundamentals of machine learning,
* discrete-event simulation modeling (queueing systems),
* mathematical modeling (static/dynamic systems analysis — phase-space trajectories),
* fundamentals of biology and chemistry enabling work with bioinformatics and medical informatics (digital processing of
  biomedical images).

## Interests and abilities

My interests are mainly focused on topics related to multimedia processing, including primarily:

* digital image processing, including medical imaging and computer vision,
* designing real-time audio/video streaming applications for highly distributed environments.

I am enthusiastic of languages running on the JVM such as Java, Kotlin and Scala, but also more _exotic_ ones such as
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org).

I am proficient in a number of popular programming languages (Java, Kotlin, Javascript, Typescript, PHP, C#, C, Python)
and to a greater or lesser extent I know the basics of several other languages (Scala, C++, Matlab, R) including those
_exotic_ (the aforementioned [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) language).

## Technologies

Technologies I'm working with in my current projects:

* JVM (Kotlin, Java, Scala; Spring and Spring Boot ecosystems),
* C/C++ (JNI, DSP in field of audio modulation and multimedia processing: SRT, OpenCV, LavaDSP),
* Python (process automation, digital images processing, scientific simulations: OpenCV, Pandas, PyWavelets, Matplotlib,
  Numpy, Scipy),
* JavaScript/TypeScript (with Next.js and React ecosystem: Redux Toolkit, RTK Query and Tanstack Query;
  websites and rapid prototyping),
* Message brokers (RabbitMQ),
* GCP (KMS, Compute Engine),
* Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, BetterStack),
* DevOps (Cloudflare, Caddy, Hashicorp Vault, Minio, GitHub Actions, Docker),
* LaTeX.

Technologies I know and have used in the past:

* .NET (C#, ASP.NET WebAPI, WinForms),
* Angular ecosystem (with RxJS),
* Apache Kafka (fault tolerant distributed data streams, event-driven architecture),
* microservices (Spring Cloud architecture),
* Scilab (circuits simulations),
* Apache Cassandra,
* Redis,
* AWS (EC2, Lambda, KMS, S3, DynamoDB),
* Matlab (digital signals/images processing),
* PHP (native),
* Android (Java).

## Hobby

Privately a homebody, an enthusiast of film music, classical, and cross-genre music, a connoisseur of independent
arthouse movies and Open Source software.
