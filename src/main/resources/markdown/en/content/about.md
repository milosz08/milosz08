## About me

Currently master of science student at Silesian University of Technology (faculty of Automatic Control, Electronics and
Computer Science, spec: Internet and Networking Technologies).

In january 2024 I defended Bachelor of Engineering at the same university. My thesis was about demostrate posibilities
of communication in a highly distributed microservice infrastructure using Apache Kafka event-driven architecture in
field of real-time communication on example of chat application.

Source code you find [here](https://github.com/visphere).

I am currently focusing on research involving the use of wavelet transform for edge detection in practical applications
of MRI image analysis, considering various levels of noise and artifacts. I intend to incorporate the results of this
research into my master's thesis.

## Education

* **2024 - current**: (MSc, BEng) Computer Science, Silesian University of Technology,
* **2020 - 2024**: (BEng) Computer Science, Silesian University of Technology,
* **2017 - 2020**: High School of the Evangelical Society in Cieszyn (Biology-Chemistry profile).

## Interests

My interests are mainly focused on topics related to multimedia processing, including primarily:

- selected methods of digital audio and image processing,
- designing real-time audio/video streaming applications for highly distributed environments,
- selected applications of digital image processing, including medical imaging and computer vision.

I am enthusiastic of languages running on the JVM such as Java, Kotlin and Scala, but also more _exotic_ ones such as
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org).

I am proficient in a number of popular programming languages (Java, Kotlin, Javascript, Typescript, PHP, C#) and to a
greater or lesser extent I know the basics of several other languages (Python, Scala, C++, Matlab) including those
_exotic_ (the aforementioned [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) language).

## Technologies

Technologies I'm working with in my current projects:

- JVM (Kotlin, Java, Scala; Spring and Spring Boot ecosystems),
- C/C++ (JNI, DSP in field of audio modulation and multimedia processing),
- Python (process automation, digital images processing, scientific simulations),
- JavaScript/TypeScript (with web frameworks: Next.js, React ecosystem; websites and rapid prototyping),
- Message brokers (RabbitMQ),
- DevOps (Nginx, Prometheus, Grafana, Hashicorp Vault, Minio, GitHub Actions, BetterStack).

Technologies I know and have used in the past:

- .NET (C#, ASP.NET WebAPI, WinForms),
- Angular ecosystem (with RxJS),
- Apache Kafka (fault tolerant distributed data streaming, event-driven architecture),
- microservices (Spring Cloud architecture),
- Scilab (circuits simulations),
- Apache Cassandra,
- AWS (EC2, Lambda, KMS, S3, DynamoDB),
- Matlab (digital signals/images processing),
- PHP (native),
- Android (Java).

## Hobby

Privately a homebody, enthusiast of orchestral film music, fan of hard science-fiction, Open Source software and IoT
devices (Raspberry PI).
